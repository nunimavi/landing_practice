# Landing Page Recreation from Figma
Hello! 👋🏼

I recreated a [landing page design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1208269880606123705) from Figma to strengthen my HTML and CSS skills, focusing on semantic structure, layout, and responsive design.

🔗 Check out the live project [here](https://nunimavi.github.io/landing_practice/).

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still a work in progress.
